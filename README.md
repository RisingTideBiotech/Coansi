# Coansi
A PRE-BETA RELEASE OF COANSI MADE FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

## Coansi README
Coansi operates through a macro script that uses Java and HTML.

## Installation
The core of Coansi is a script called:
Coansi.ijm
To use Coansi, the user will follow this path:
[ij152-win-java8] > ImageJ > macros > toolsets >
Then move the scipt file into this location.

Alternately, the user can follow this path:
[ij152-win-java8] > ImageJ > macros >
Then replace the installed StartupMacros.txt contents with the Coansi version of this file. Do not alter the name of the file.

## REQUIREMENTS
To use Coansi, ImageJ must be installed. This can be found at:
https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html

Coansi was built using ImageJ version 1.52a. If the user encounters multiple problems running Coansi, it may be an ImageJ version compatibility error, or interference from previously downloaded plugins. If this is suspected, it is recommended for the user to try the same version of ImageJ in which Coansi was built. This can be found at:
http://wsr.imagej.net/distros/

The direct download for windows is at:
http://wsr.imagej.net/distros/win/ij152-win-java8.zip

The direct download for osx is at:
http://wsr.imagej.net/distros/osx/ij152-osx-java8.zip

## USAGE
Coansi is designed to run through the right-click menu and toolset buttons within ImageJ on a Windows OS. The user calls the program through the "More Tools" menu on the toolbar. Detailed usage information is embedded in Coansi and can be accessed at any time through the Help menus.

## ABOUT
Coansi \\KOHN-see\\ stands for Counts and size. It is designed to be a desktop alternative to counting microscopic objects and performing morphometric assessment at the microscope. Coansi allows the user to perform measurements on any computer that has enough RAM to open a z-stack. This limits the amount of exposure to fluorescence preparations and the burden on time-shared equipment.

The program was built using a java macro language on the ImageJ 1.52a source code [release April 2018] and Zeiss 10X (1 micron : 1.4 pixels) and 100X (1 micron : 11.4 pixels) z-stacks. Coansi comprises a mix of known stereology tools and custom probes based on mathematical theory and classic geometric principles. All probes should be user tested by someone with a full understanding of stereological theory. A program is not substitute for knowledge but a tool to implement knowledge.

Coansi was conceived of and designed by Christy M. Kelley while working in the laboratory of Elliott J. Mufson; it was designed for Megan K. Gautier while working in the laboratory of Stephen D. Ginsberg. It was written 2019-2020.
